# Cat Facts

Cat Facts is a React Redux application that helps practice how to handle user authentication, working with external APIs and using Redux toolkit in your application. The application consumes data from my backend API which can be found by the following URL ```https://rails-fetch-be.onrender.com/```


Youcan have a look at the backend repository [here](https://github.com/Nemwel-Boniface/rails_fetch_be).


Enjoy!
